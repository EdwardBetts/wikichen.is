              <h2>NeverWet Vans</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>A few years ago Ross Nanotechnology <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7is6r6zXFDc">posted a video</a> of a special coating which seems to magically repel any liquid when applied to a surface: chocolate syrup is poured over a treated pair of sneakers, but they emerge dry and unscathed. The demonstration quickly went viral, but it wasn’t until recently that you were able to purchase this unbelievable superhydrophobic repellant <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/204216476">at your local Home Depot</a> for $20.</p>

<p>In the spirit of scientific curiosity and particular boredom, I decided to put NeverWet to the test by coating my aging pair of white canvas Vans.</p>

<p><img src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/neverwet_cans.jpg" alt="NeverWet Cans" /></p>

<p>The repellant comes in the two spray paint cans, and the application process is surprisingly straightforward. You simply apply a base coat with one can, wait 30 minutes, then spray a top coat with the other, and wait another half an hour to cure. The instructions encourage you to apply several layers for optimal coverage, which I did just to be on the safe side. The two-can set only contains enough to cover only 10 to 15 square feet, however, so do exercise some restraint if you want your fun to last.</p>

<p>There’s a big caveat to the wow factor of the product and a major flaw the videos don’t mention (and cleverly so). The repellant leaves a milky, frosty white texture to the application surface. In my case, my Vans’ natural white coloring blends in perfectly with that of NeverWet, but don’t expect a differently colored shoe or item to retain its appearance. There’s a reason most of the items demoed in the promo videos are white or clear.</p>

<p>My Vans turned out pristine and worked great initially, but after several days of use I started to notice some annoying shortcomings of the product. For starters, the coating doesn’t actually make the shoes dirt-proof, but since the shoes are now completely superhydrophobic, it makes cleaning them nigh on impossible. The sanest way is to wait until the NeverWet layer wears off, which fortunately (or not, which is another problem I have) means roughly a week. To make matters worse, the frosty, gritty texture also rubs off easily on your hand in this sticky, flaky mess, which becomes evident when I’m putting my Vans on.</p>

<p>The silver lining here is that these occasions happen way less often than when my Vans were AlwaysWet, whereby every other week I’d have to scrape the shoes with baking soda to remove some ungodly stain from god knows where.</p>

<p>Imperfections aside, NeverWet does deliver on its promise to tame your spillage nightmares. In the week it’s lasted, my Vans have magically eluded otherwise grisly stains from steak sauce, pho soup, alcohol, gasoline, precipitation, lobster juice, and most importantly, those damn ill-timed piss shivers (guys you know what I’m talking about). NeverWet is a blessing for idiots like me who insist on wearing white Vans and hate cleaning them.</p>

<p>If you want to see NeverWet in action, I’ve uploaded a video where I pour a bottle of Mexican coke and some ketchup on my treated shoes. The way the liquid bounes off the canvas in droplet form never ceases to amaze me.</p>

<p>Apparently Rust-Oleum, the brilliant minds behind NeverWet, are hard at work on a next iteration that dries clear, but until then I can’t really recommend their product for everyday use around the house. The undesirable layer the repellant leaves on surfaces severely limits its application, and it rubs off too easily and wears off too fast to be useful for things like shoes or clothes.</p>

<p>But if you’re looking for a relatively cheap way to stave off boredom and blow your own mind with the power of science, then NeverWet is your ticket to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/neverwet-review-the-magical-water-repelling-spray-is-812797429">an amazing good time</a>.</p>
