              <h2>Lessons Learned Writing, Part I</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>At the beginning of August I started a project to <a href="/write-like-a-motherfucker/">write everyday for a year</a>. 2 weeks, 17 posts, 13k words, 50k views, and a lot of caffeine later, I’m happy to be writing this update to share what I’ve learned and to propose some appropriate changes to the scope of the project.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="writing-is-scary-and-hard-but-do-it-anyway">Writing is scary and hard. But do it anyway.</h2>

<p>A lot of people messaged me expressing interest in what I’m doing. <em>I want to write, and I wish I had time and the guts to put everything out there</em>, they said. That’s a nice bullshit excuse you’ve got there.</p>

<p><img src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/pageviews.jpg" alt="Page Views" /></p>

<p>I didn’t start writing because I thought I was good enough. Hell, I still think most of what I write is complete and utter horseshit. But so what? Your writing will never get better if you don’t write. I decided to write with complete transparency because it keeps me accountable to my peers and the world at large. I make sure people read what I write, so I can get better at writing and have no excuse when I don’t produce—<em>shit, people actually read my stuff, better make sure to write more</em>.</p>

<p>Write for yourself, write what you care about. Writing frequently helps make the actual products of writing less personal, and it helps to take things less personally because there will be days when your posts are bad and either nobody reads them or everyone hates them. Which brings us to my next point: making people care about what you write.</p>

<h2 id="nobody-will-care-unless-you-make-the-effort-to-share">Nobody will care unless you make the effort to share.</h2>

<p>It pisses me off to see <a href="https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/f7dfa4c0625a">self-serving posts like this</a> on Medium in which the author argues that a curated publishing platform is where nobodies like himself truly belong. I’m sorry, but the reason why nobody reads your crap is because you don’t care enough to do the hard work after you’re done writing. It promotes a lazy attitude of publishing, whereby the author simply sits around after he’s hit the Submit button and expects thousands of readers to just flock to his elegantly crafted post.</p>

<p>Open your eyes, because I’ll have you know that <em>the entire Internet</em> is for nobodies like us.</p>

<p>I’m a nobody. I have fewer followers and friends on social networks than what Justin Bieber’s accounts eat for breakfast. Yet I still manage to help people find and read the stuff I write, because I care to make the effort to share—I want my writing out there for the world to read and judge and share. It’s hard to make people care when you don’t.</p>

<p><img src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/reddit_submissions.jpg" alt="Reddit Submissions" /></p>

<p>For starters, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> is a fantastic place to share your writing. There are hundreds upon hundreds of subreddits catering to every niche subject you can think of. There’s a subreddit for everything, so you really have no excuse. It’s also a great place to get feedback: if your post gets upvoted, there must be something people liked that you could take away for your next post, and vice versa.</p>

<p>When my post on <a href="/the-tao-of-pooh/">The Tao of Pooh</a> hit the front page of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/books">r/books</a>, it sent more than 40,000 hits to my site. Other posts didn’t do so well. Like I said, you win some days, you lose some days. Keep writing and carry on.</p>

<h2 id="writing-has-become-one-of-my-most-rewarding-creative-feedback-loops">Writing has become one of my most rewarding creative feedback loops.</h2>

<p>The most surprising benefit I found in writing with a schedule is how much it challenges and pushes my creative side. Publishing on a regular basis gives my day-to-day life some semblance of progress. It also helps frame my days under a narrative lens that seek to derive meaning from otherwise mundane observations about life and my interests. I’m learning more about myself as I write, and this feedback loop has become a positive driving force in my self-expression and creative identity.</p>

<p>Writing has also led me to connect with people I wouldn’t have otherwise had the opportunity to interact with, and I’m always pleasantly surprised when people reach out to me to express their own sentiments or spur their own discussions regarding my writing. It’s one of the most rewarding feelings I’ve ever experienced doing anything.</p>

<hr />

<p>To that end, I want to make some changes to the project. <span class="highlight">Instead of writing everyday, I’m going to publish a longer post every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</span></p>

<p>The daily constraint really puts pressure on shipping content that may not be all that interesting or substantive. The off days will be much needed time to flesh out my ideas, and the decreased posting frequency will allow me to develop meatier pieces that are more engaging and informative. Part of this is because I discovered many of my posts are media heavy, and processing images really cut into my allocated writing time, even though they’re just as relevant and important to the content of the posts.</p>

<p>I also underestimated how much development time this blog needs. On the weekends, rather than write, I want to instead use that time to make improvements to the design and functionality of the blog. Good design can make better reading experiences, and as a designer with a vested interest in web publishing, this is the perfect medium on which to experiment and play with elements like typography, responsive layouts, flexible grids, and creative storytelling.</p>

<p>Lastly, it really makes my day when I know that people are taking the time to read my writing, so I want to say thanks to all the friends and strangers alike who have read, shared, or given me feedback on my posts. You’re a large part of why I continue to write, and your support means everything to me.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for much more.</p>
