        <title>Beyond Mordor: The Power of Completionism</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally published on Medium, which never saw many views. I hope it finds a new audience here, as it explores two of my favorite things: video games and user-centered design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t seem long ago that my brother and I were excitedly fantasizing about a potential Lego game by Traveller’s Tales set in J. R. R. Tolkien’s epic Middle Earth as we smashed and built our way through their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars:_The_Video_Game&quot;&gt;original brickified Star Wars games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t had the pleasure of playing any of the Lego video games, here’s how Traveller’s Tales’ tried-and-true formula works: license a Lego product line based on a successful, mass market movie and/or book franchise, design levels around the main events of the story, turn the environment and characters into plastic bricks, sprinkle a ton of collectibles for replayability and a dash of kid-friendly humor, add easy drop-in/drop-out cooperative play, and voila, you have a fun, addicting game that seems to capture the essence of its source material generally better than its more true-to-life counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother and I have played just about every Lego game since the inception of the franchise seven odd years ago, so imagine our giddy delight when we found out Traveller’s Tales brought the newest &lt;a href=&quot;http://thelordoftherings.lego.com/&quot;&gt;The Lord of the Rings Lego sets&lt;/a&gt; into digital life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as gameplay is concerned, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; follows the franchise recipe down to the letter. What stood out to me, and perhaps what made this entry such a compelling case study of game design, is the sheer amount of additional content Traveller’s Tales put into the game that sets it apart from its predecessors, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/legolotr_screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Lego LotR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a seemingly endless amount of things to collect in Lego Middle Earth: Mithril bricks to find for crafting tools, characters to meet and do fetch quests for, treasures to unearth, and Lego studs for currency. That Middle Earth is rendered as an open world (instead of a much smaller hub in the previous games) is a testament to the time and effort it takes to obtain 100% completion of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game, in its mad attempt to be crowned the Witch-king of collectibles, awakened some latent obsessive-compulsive tendencies that ultimately drove me to achieve that 100% status. Towards the end, I wasn’t playing for fun anymore. I played for completion, for a sense of closure a number would bring, knowing I have done and conquered everything the game had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;completionism-in-practice&quot;&gt;Completionism in Practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see completionism at work in contexts surrounding us and in a lot of the things we do. The human need for completion and closure is best explained by the New Yorker article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/04/why-we-need-answers.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why We Need Answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we can’t immediately gratify our desire to know, we become highly motivated to reach a concrete explanation. That motivation…lies at the heart of most other common motives: achievement, affiliation, power, and the like. We want to eliminate the distress of the unknown. We want, in other words, to achieve “cognitive closure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relating to cognitive science, Gestalt psychology states under the Law of Closure that the human mind attempts to fill in gaps wherever incompleteness is present, that is, we instinctively strive to reach a state of closure when things are incomplete. Humans have a deep-rooted psychological drive to finish tasks, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Zeigarnik_Effect&quot;&gt;Zeigarnik effect&lt;/a&gt;, which observes that people remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. In my case, the incompleted state of the &lt;em&gt;Lego LotR&lt;/em&gt; game created tension, improving cognitive accessibility to the task-relevant details (or more specifically, an obsessive need for its completion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the design world, a recent trend in web usability is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/CompletenessMeter&quot;&gt;completeness meter&lt;/a&gt;, a feature usually implemented on sites to encourage users to fill in profile fields or perform certain tasks. The meter tracks the progress of the user towards a completion rate, drawing on psychological factors like feedback loop and positive reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/completeness_meter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Examples of the Completeness Meter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of these “gamified” techniques tapping into completionism warrants some scrutiny, because as my time with &lt;em&gt;Lego LotR&lt;/em&gt; showed, this completionist-driven behavior may not be all roses and toy bricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-and-evil-of-completionism&quot;&gt;The Good and Evil of Completionism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Lego LotR&lt;/em&gt; shows, capitalizing on our inherent need for completion can capture the player’s attention and help them derive more enjoyment and value from the game, but to an extent. In an ideal scenario, everyone wins; the developer creates a better game and the user enjoys a better game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The completeness meter is a great UX tool that takes advantage of completionism to better the product experience for both the developer and the user. It helps guide the user through the interface and track their progression through the site, offering feedback on how they can improve their utility of the service. At the same time, the increased engagement and self-directed activity benefit the developers, allowing them to learn more about their users and iterate on the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth thinking about the context in which completionism may be detrimental to the user experience. In my time with &lt;em&gt;Lego LotR&lt;/em&gt;, my behavior devolved from playing for fun and engagement into a rather pointless binge for completion. It added nothing to my enjoyment of the game and, to a degree, tainted my impression of its quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing to bring about completionistic tendencies, it’s also important to think about the type of users who would actually be turned off by a persistent reminder of their lack of progress. I often find myself annoyed at having to close the panels on Google+ reminding me to fill in my profile information when I have no desire to do so. Not everyone has the same attitude towards completionism, so tread carefully when introducing these mechanics to different users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made &lt;em&gt;Lego LotR&lt;/em&gt; so addicting—tapping on gamers’ tendencies to do everything to extend replayability of the interactive experience—is not new in game design, but the implications of replicating this completionist behavior elsewhere, such as in web usability, pose an interesting use case for product designers to better serve the needs of users and the product when implemented properly and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
