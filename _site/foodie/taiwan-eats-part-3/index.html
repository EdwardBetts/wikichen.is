<p><em>This is a 3-part series on Taiwanese food culture: <a href="/taiwan-eats-part-1/">Part 1</a> explores food you find on the streets, <a href="/taiwan-eats-part-2/">Part 2</a> talks about family style eating, and <a href="/taiwan-eats-part-3/">Part 3</a> highlights some of my favorite dishes.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>The best part about going back to Taiwan was getting to eat some of the favorite things I ate growing up.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Tofu" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-tofu.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Douhua (豆花) or tofu pudding is a Chinese dessert consisting of very soft tofu. Sometimes toppings like tapioca pearls are added for more flavoring. It’s a traditional Taiwanese dish and a refreshing treat on a hot day. Think pudding with a softer, soy twist.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Almond Tofu" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-almondtofu.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Almond tofu (杏仁豆腐) is very similar to tofu pudding in consistency, but it’s made with apricot kernels and as such has a very distinctive, savory taste. It’s a dessert usually served, as in the dish above, with toppings, such as red and green beans.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Black Tea" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-blacktea.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Being the birthplace of the popular tapioca drink (also known as boba) and a huge exporter in teas (accounting for about 20% of global production of oolongs), Taiwan has some of the best tea shops in the world. That means black tea that will blow your mind. It’s the perfect summer’s drink.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Porridge" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-porridge.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Since I was a kid I’ve had an affinity for rice porridge. It’s also a very traditional Taiwanese breakfast item when coupled with a variety of side dishes and eggs.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Condiments" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-condiments.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Spiced bamboo shoots, pickled vegetables, and rousong (also called meat floss) are some of the side dishes we eat with porridge. The relative blandness of the porridge accompanied by the strong flavors of these processed sides make for an interesting and delicious palette.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Eggs" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-eggs.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Different types of eggs are also part of the side dish selection, in particular century eggs and salted duck eggs. Both are preserved in special ways, but the tastes are wildly different. Century eggs have dark green yolks and brown, translucent whites, with a creamy consistency and smell like ammonia, while salted eggs have a briny texture due to the salt curing process, with a firm yolk that’s bright orange.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Sausage" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-sausage.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Taiwanese sausages are miles ahead of American ones in the taste department. Due to the emulsification process of the fat and meat, Taiwanese sausages generally contain more sugar and thus are sweeter in taste. They’re aptly called xiangchang (香腸), which translates to fragrant sausage.</p>

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Tapioca Dessert" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part3-tapioca.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Quite possibly my favorite dessert of all time, tapioca is traditionally used in desserts much like this one, instead of the boba balls you typically see in drinks. The small tapioca pearls are combined with grass jelly and other equally delectable jelly substances in a soup-like concoction, and the result is life-alteringly amazing.</p>

<hr />

<p>I hope you enjoyed this gastronomic tour of Taiwan. What I’ve shown, however, only scratches the surface of Taiwanese cuisine. If you’re interested in learning more, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_cuisine">Wikipedia page</a> goes into more detail about the customs and nuances of Taiwanese food. I also <a href="/photowalking-through-a-taiwanese-night-market/">take a photowalk through a Taiwanese night market</a> in another post, which is arguably the best way to experience the amazing culinary side of Taiwan.</p>
