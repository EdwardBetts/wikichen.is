<p>If there’s a definitive activity you should do while visiting Taiwan, it’s to set aside an evening to experience the sights, sounds, and smells of a Taiwanese night market. With over one hundred night markets in Taiwan, these ephemeral street markets of the late evenings offer some of the most authentic cultural impressions and local foods (we call these roadside dishes xiaochi 小吃, which roughly translates to snacks or fast food) you’ll find on this side of Asia. Let’s take a walk through a typical night market (this particular one is called <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/%E8%8A%B1%E5%9C%92%E5%A4%9C%E5%B8%82/4bb860e153649c74b6fb46fb">Huayuan Night Market</a> 花園夜市, located in Tainan).</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice is that it really does feel like a market: crowded and noisy, as if all the chaotic elements of the universe decided to descend upon this small congested plot of bedazzled land on this fateful night of your visit. You’ll have a hard time wading through the sea of eager, hungry patrons, whose foot traffic is reduced to the narrow walkways between rows of makeshift stands, while your head busily tries to discern the cacophony of smells flooding your nostrils. It’s all a bit too overwhelming, but that’s the essential charm of the night market—ordered chaos in the midst of bewildering unknowns. Learn to embrace it, and try not to get lost.</p>

</div>

<p>You’ll find all sorts of interesting edible things here. No, stop making that face, get a grip. There are skewers of every variety: beef, lamb, fish balls, congealed pig blood, squid, and so much more. Squid on a stick is a staple at night markets. Stop squirming—this is some next level delicious seafood shit <em>on a stick</em>. Try one, I promise it tastes better than it looks.</p>

<p>I can’t even begin to fathom all of the small delicacies they sell: octopus parts, banded seaweed, soy bean curds, duck innards, various pickled vegetables, marinated meats of every color and spice, to name a few. If you’re vegetarian, you’re going to have a bad time. Otherwise, go crazy like I usually do—sample everything, because most of this stuff is beyond tasty.</p>

<p>Oysters are a big part of the Taiwanese night market palette, and they go especially well in a couple of signature dishes: oyster vermicelli (蚵仔麵線) and oyster omelette (蚵仔煎). The vermicelli dish is a noodle soup with a sticky, gooey base derived from the caramelized sugars of the vermicelli dough, while the omelette is a favorite dish among foreigners comprising potato starch and egg batter as the wrap, topped off with a savory sauce—the result is a chewy, sweet mouthfeel that is out of this world.</p>

<p>Another classic night market eat is the stinky tofu (臭豆腐). It smells like ass to those unfamiliar, and you can usually tell from a mile away. The odor is attributed to the fermentation of the tofu, which is then deep fried and served with chili sauce. The authentic stands would include a side of sweet and sour pickled cabbage, which helps alleviate the greasiness of the tofu. It’s a unique Taiwanese dish not for the faint of heart, but those who smell past its stench are privy to enjoy what I deem to be a hidden gastronomic treasure of Taiwan.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Even the sweets and desserts are full of endless variety and delight. The sheer amount of stuff available (that’s actually palatable to those who would rather keep diabetes away) puts any American candy store to shame. In the mood for something sweet and savory? We have mochi treats, plus you can dip it in a bunch of awesome flavors: green tea, red bean, sesame, you name it. Just writing about them makes my mouth water.</p>

<p>Night markets are one of my favorite facets of Taiwanese culture. They imbue all the great things about my people: the rowdy, happy-go-lucky crowds, the dazzling colors of tradition, the myriad culinary surprises that captivate those more adventurously inclined. If you want to experience Asian culture at its best, start here.</p>
