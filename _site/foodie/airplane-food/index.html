              <h2>Airplane Food</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>On my 13-hour flight on China Airlines from Los Angeles to Taipei, it dawned upon me that while I’ve traveled extensively within the United States for the past year, my passport has remained dusty and unadorned since I returned to Taiwan seven years ago.</p>

<p>A few hours after our departure at 4PM, the food cart rolled around and the flight attendants began serving dinner.</p>

<p>My stomach turned.</p>

<p>Despite a long hiatus from international travel, my memory still served me well: airline meals, or what usually appeared to be colorless blobs of unappetizing grub and tasted equally delectable, are not food.</p>

<p>I found myself staring at the tray, unsure if I should betray my better judgment, but hunger’s a conniving temptress when you’re stuck 30,000 ft in the air. With equal parts caution and dread, I took a bite out of the chicken. <em>Odd, this actually tastes like chicken.</em> The potatoes weren’t half bad either. And the fruits tasted sweet, the slice of raspberry red velvet cake delightful.</p>

<p>Then breakfast came around. Fish porridge garnished with ginger and green onions, served with marinated bean curd skin. It, too, was nowhere near as bad as I remembered, insofar as I actually enjoyed it.</p>

<p>My mind raced. Has my memory failed me, or have airline meals actually improved? Does China Airlines just serve better food than anyone else? Is this real life, or did I swallow a red pill in one of the snack bags?</p>

<p>The less than expected experience piqued my curiosity, and I started to find the subject of designing food for less than ideal contexts fascinating. Researching around the topic, I came across <a href="http://www.quora.com/Food/Why-is-airplane-food-so-terrible/answer/Jay-Wacker">an excellent overview by Jay Wacker</a>, a physics professor at Stanford, breaking down the set of problems that culinary engineers face when tackling food for airlines (and learned in the process why my meals on China Airlines tasted better):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because it is really hard, though not impossible.</p>

  <p>The real issue though is that the constraints upon airplane food are pretty severe. Airplanes aren’t kitchens and you have a lot of people to serve.  Think about trying to do a 450 person wedding and remember that there’s a lot of bad wedding food and then remember that the nearest kitchen was 2 hours away at serving time.</p>

  <p>So I’ll just run through my observations on the travails of the different possible menu items.</p>

  <p>For a hot meal right after take off, you have to make a meal that can take being heated for a long period of time in the serving container.   The food is precooked or par-cooked and kept at temperature (they can’t do on-the-spot cooking, and they don’t have the energy budget to cook-then-refrigerate-then-reheat).  The shortest hold times are usually about 60 to 90 minutes.  So except for stews, say goodbye to any delicate proteins. Vegetables are even tough to do well.  A lot of starches begin to break down.  Nevertheless, if you notice, you get the best meal right after take-off (and why they serve dinner at 4pm) because it is easiest high quality meal to get to the passengers.</p>

  <p>For meals served well after take-off (usually transoceanic flights only), they have to heat from scratch.  The ovens are pretty terrible, totally packed with food (450 meals from a few galleys), not consistent heating, and operating on a tight energy budget.  You can’t afford to undercook anything or burn something, so you have to be super-careful about choices.</p>

  <p>Once you take into account the immense variety of dietary restrictions that airplanes have to cater to: vegetarians, vegans, pescatarians, allergies of all different varieties, spice-haters, lactose intolerance, pregnant women, people with suppressed immune systems,  etc and you start to realize just what type of situation these airlines are in: being something for everyone. Ultimately, you have to hit the lowest common denominator.  Finally, if there is any food-borne illness, there is going to be a serious problem (can you imagine a run on the restrooms over the Pacific).  So safety first and if compromises in taste are necessary, so be it.</p>

  <p>Finally, you have very tight budgets for ingredients.  Airlines really push to get the lowest fares.  People make a decision based on $5.  If the airlines can knock that off the fare, they’ll do it, particularly in coach.  A first cousin (once removed) worked for a major airline and described to me how they went through and decided to scrap the junky black olives in salads and it saved the airline $3M a year (a few cents for 80M passengers per year).  They really do scrutinize budgets down to the last ingredient.</p>

  <p>For me, the best meals usually are the ones on Asian airlines which serve curries over rice or various stews over rice.  They can be done quite cheaply.  They hold well.  But they disagree with a lot of Western palates, so they aren’t used on many European or American airlines.</p>

<p>The gist is clear: serving quality airplane food is a hard engineering problem. But as nature would have it, another source of complication is our own biology. As <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/12/03/26/1420254/science-reveals-why-airplane-food-tastes-so-bad">Hugh Pickens on Slashdot</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At low elevations, the 10,000 or so taste buds in the human mouth work pretty much as nature intended. But step aboard a modern airliner, and the sense of taste loses its bearings. Even before a plane takes off, the atmosphere inside the cabin dries out the nose. As the plane ascends, the change in air pressure numbs about a third of the taste buds, and at 35,000 feet with cabin humidity levels kept low by design to reduce the risk of fuselage corrosion, xerostomia or cotton mouth sets in. This explain why airlines tend to salt and spice food heavily. Without all that extra kick, food tastes bland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also interesting is an alternative hypothesis proposed by a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329310001217">2011 study</a> in the journal <em>Food Quality and Preference</em> which suggests that the loud, constant hum of aircraft engines is actually the source of blandness of airplane food.</p>

<p>Add in food safety standards that require all airline meals to be cooked first on the ground, the blast-chill and refrigeration process of meals that prevent extensive flavoring, financial pressures and the need to cater to a highly divergent set of restrictive diets, and you have a pretty intimidating list of headaches and challenges making the case that preparing good tasting food on planes is an ever elusive goal.</p>

<p>All this casts a pretty grim outlook on the future of airplane food, especially for people like me who are too cheap to fly anything but economy. However, that such negative feelings and prevalent discontent toward free meals offered in a giant metal tube cruising the skies at 600 mph invites the commentary that maybe we as modern travelers are just too spoiled. I hope this post serves to better educate and engender some appreciation for the challenges airlines face everyday to serve food with such extreme constraints.</p>

<p>Next time I’m served a meal on the plane, I’ll think twice before I complain.</p>
