    <p class="intro">My (real) name is <em>Jonathan E. Chen</em>. I go by <em>wikichen</em> on the web. I can't exactly say what I am&mdash;defined as a member of society, not as an entity in the universe, in which case I would be a homo sapien, an animal, a collection of atoms, sentient stardust, and so forth&mdash;because, as fate would have it, I'm not exactly sure yet, so I've decided to collect a whole bunch of things I do here to make sense of my life and hope it leads me somewhere.</p>

    <p>I haven't really thought out my little corner of the Internet, but as an exercise in the “shipped is better than perfect” school of thought, I'll add content first and make improvements over time; hopefully, my dear visitor, you'll appreciate being taken along for the ride.

      </ul>

    <p>Who knows, maybe I don't need to know what I am to the world to mean something to it.</p>
