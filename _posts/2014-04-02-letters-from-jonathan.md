Keeping in touch with the people who matter in my life, as well as cultivating the relationships that can potentially become just as important, has been a particular pain point for me over the past several years as I ventured out into the real world.

So I've decided to finally make something to solve it.

Introducing [*Letters from Jonathan*](/personal/).

Why letters? Probably because I'm an introvert at heart. I can't stand talking on the phone lest there's nothing to say, but I can write one hell of an articulate letter. I've also started reaching out to mentors and teachers, people who aren't exactly active online but are just as significant in my life. I'm really looking forward to connecting with all these lovely people again.

The first letter should be out at end of the month, which I hope would set the precedent for the newsletter's direction to be more of a monthly retrospective. But anything goes. Even if you're just a passerby on the Internet, you're more than welcome to sign up for my newsletter---this is also my dorky way of making and keeping friends on the web. Stay tuned.
