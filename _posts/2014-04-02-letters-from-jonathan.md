Keeping in touch with the people who matter in my life, as well as cultivating the relationships that can potentially become just as important, has been a particular pain point for me over the past several years as I ventured out into the real world.

So I decided to finally make something to solve it in my own way.

Introducing [*Letters from Jonathan*](/personal/).

I've written enough words today, so I'll let the page do all the talking. I've also launched it on my Facebook account with the post copied below.

> Dear friends, "friends", the recently friended, friends-to-be, soon-to-be-former-friends, and randos,
>
> You're looking at the first and last post on my Wall. It's also probably the first time in a while you've seen anything from me posted here, that is, if Facebook feels generous enough to share it with you. If you judge my life by my Facebook activity you'd probably think I'm dead in a ditch somewhere, but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I'm doing quite well in my ditch, all things considered.
>
> That's the problem, isn't it? With Facebook in particular. There's a whole lot of noise and not a lot of meaningful signal. Sometimes I leave the site a little sadder than when I enter. Some of you might be okay with that, but I don't think it's entirely unreasonable for me to want my social network to be, well, a little more personal and a little more thoughtful. (If for some reason you do want to follow the impersonal and the thoughtless, I do have a Twitter account for that purpose: @wikichen)
>
> This is not a breakup letter to Facebook. I know better than to swear it off altogether after several laughably short-lived attempts in the past. You'll still see me here from time to time in the outer fringes, mainly lurking in groups and stalking my "Close Friends" list comprising unsurprisingly few of my actual close friends. Granted, this account is kept alive primarily for accessing other sites and for the demon spawn that is Messenger. The point is that I won't spend any more time here than I have to—not that my past activity has been particularly out of control. This is just my own idiosyncratic way of reaching closure, which brings me to the gist of my post.

> I've decided to finally take responsibility for nurturing the existing relationships in my life and for cultivating new ones, but I can't do that here. Instead, I'm kicking it old-school and returning to email, in the form of a monthly personal newsletter called "Letters from Jonathan". You can read about it in detail through the link below:

> If you actually like this post, subscribe to my letters instead of hitting the 'Like' button. If you don't know me at all, here is your chance to either unfriend me or get to know me a little better. If we've grown estranged, I hope you accept this as a token of my apologies and as an opportunity to renew our friendship. If we're friends already, you should definitely hop onboard so you can give me even more shit for the things I say.

> I can't guarantee that the letters will be any good, but I do promise that they will be personal and that they will be thoughtful. In exchange, I hope that some of you will take the time to reply, knowing that each letter is a shameless excuse to start a more intimate conversation, to catch up as friends old & new, and to learn more about each other beyond the Likes.

Why letters? Probably because I'm an introvert at heart. I can't stand talking on the phone lest there's nothing to say, but I can write one hell of a mean letter. Well, a personal one, but you know that's just an expression. I've also started reaching out to mentors and teachers, people who aren't exactly active online but are just as significant in my life, so fingers crossed that the reception will be good.

The first letter should be out at end of the month, which I hope would set the precedent for the newsletter's direction to be more of a monthly retrospective. But anything goes. For now, it'll be nice to finally have a more sizable audience to write to and connect with.
