> From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole I’ve been told what I must do and who I must be. I’ve been shrunk, stretched, scratched, and stuffed into a teapot. I’ve been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice, but this is MY dream. I’ll decide where it will go from here.

Guillermo del Toro's *Pacific Rim* was one of the most spectacular movies I've seen in recent memory for many reasons. That watching gigantic mechas duke it out with gigantic monsters on the gigantic canvas of a theater screen was some of the most unadulterated, visceral fun I've experienced in cinema is a sore understatement. But what I found most surprisingly poignant was the film's sweeping commentary on the human condition and its interpretation of Alice (of *Wonderland* fame) Kingsleigh's tumble down the rabbit hole—one about moving on from the past in order to move forward.

The premise works because it doesn't pretend to be anything else but shamelessly ridiculous: an apocalyptic scenario where the humanity is under attack by giant alien monsters from the ocean called Kaijus, and giant humannoid mechas called Jaegers are created to fight them. The unifying narrative force (and the underlying ingenuity of del Toro's monster tribute) is in how these mechas are operated: each Jaeger is controlled by two pilots whose minds are locked together in a state of "neural drift". The story is set in the last days of mankind's war against the Kaijus and driven by the Jaeger Gipsy Danger and her two pilots Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori, both of whom bear equally traumatic pasts.

A particular scene in the movie struck me, and here's where it gets interesting. During the initial test run for Gipsy Danger, Becket is quick to warn Mori. *Don't chase the rabbit.* He explains that neural drifting for the first time may prove very disorienting, so it's crucial to stay focused and not to engross in the memories and impressions that surface during the drift. As with all great foreshadowing, Mori gets caught up in the neural bridge and almost destroys the Jaeger headquarters.

While it's blatantly obvious that *Pacific Rim* draws heavy inspiration from the mecha and kaiju genres popularized by Japanese culture in the 1960s (e.g., [Tetsujin 28][mecha1] and [Patlabor][mecha2]), what's more interesting are del Toro's nods to other sci-fi pictures and mediums. For example, the A.I. in *Pacific Rim* [uses the same voice as GlaDOS][glados] from Valve's Portal video game franchise. The film's reference to *Alice in Wonderland* touches on the plot device The Wachowski Brothers uses in *The Matrix*, where Neo "following the white rabbit" and picking the red pill ultimately mean going down a path of no return, i.e., the rabbit hole.

But the allegorical allusion to Lewis Carroll's psychedelic escapade (or so we've been told) in *Pacific Rim* seems to suggest something else entirely. Here the pilots are dissuaded from "chasing the rabbit" lest their neural link and control to their Jaeger be compromised. Mori's first drift gone awry caused by her inability to cope with the trauma in her childhood serves a cautionary tale: don't go too far down memory lane, because you might never come back. (Sometimes to fight for the future, you need to let go of the past.)

We christen in pop culture the nature of the rabbit hole as a gateway to the exciting unknown and the power of drugs and substances, but maybe it stands to reason, as in del Toro's portrayal of the parable, that the rabbit hole leads to the corners of our psyche and memories best left unrevisited (in my case, some breakups come to mind). Too often we dwell on our past and our failures to the detriment of our present and future, blinding ourselves from what's in front of us. As cliched as Gipsy Danger's eventual triumph over the Kaijus was, it's a sobering reminder, albeit in a touchy-feely sort of way, that our days ahead aren't determined by the demons from our past.

(Or the rabbit hole is simply just the phenomenon that explains how time moves at a relatively different pace when you're browsing Reddit at four in the morning, having promised yourself five minutes on the front page as a work break seven pages and four hours ago. You can interpret it however you want.)

*Pacific Rim* might appear to be a movie about robots fighting monsters, but it stands to offer those of us who embrace its warmer, more human stories a lesson about learning from the past and moving on. When we chase the Rabbit in our lives, it's worth considering what the pilots of Gipsy Danger came to know and what Alice realized in her time through Wonderland:

> I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.

Sometimes we just have to let the Rabbit go.
