Assessing the quality of a bygone year shouldn't be a snap binary decision, but in the case of the last twelve months, there was no shade of grey, and never had I accomplished so little and made so many mistakes than in 2013. But the great thing about failures (and having only twenty-two years on me) is that the more spectacular they are, the more transformative and invaluable the lessons they impart.

I spent the first half of 2013 working on a healthcare startup that never launched, because I started a company with the wrong people and for the wrong reasons. More importantly, we were building something people didn't want. It was one of the most painful mistakes I have ever made in my life, but perhaps the most significant in retrospect.

The second half of the year was an exercise in self-discovery. Divorced from the very venture I thought gave me purpose, I found restitution in the form of a monthlong blogging challenge that rekindled my love for writing. Convinced that design is unequivocably my vocational passion in life, I also applied to fulltime design jobs and ended up at a sharing economy startup called yerdle, where I worked as an interaction designer. It was one of the best teams I've ever worked with. Sadly, we parted ways at the end of the year, because---as fantastic as my colleagues were---I learned that I work more productively and more happily when I get to wear multiple hats and touch all aspects of the product.

2013 was not a great year by most anecdotal accounts, but perhaps it marks a turning point where, through miscalculated trials and unwarranted tribulations, the concept of who I am and what I want becomes just a little bit more defined, enough so that charting a better course for the future is a more distinct possibility.

Looking back on the past year, I have little to show but a great deal to teach, if only to remind and instruct my future self, and those unlucky enough to have gone down the same path, how to live better. I've condensed what I've learned by heart over the year into thirteen points below. (As with all advice in life, take them with a grain of salt, as your mileage may vary.)

- - -

1.  Embrace the fact that I thrive on change, and plan accordingly.

    I used to think that my insatiable need for change was a problem, but over the past year I've realized that it's just an integral part of who I am---that I stream Hype Machine because I can't listen to the same track twice, that I've moved at least a dozen times since I graduated last year, that I crave new experiences and relationships almost constantly. Life is more exciting when you learn to celebrate your quirks anyway.

1.  Consume less and create more.

    My maker's schedule takes priority over everything else. That means no more meaningless social media interactions, no more late night wanderings on reddit, no more uneducational TV shows. The only things I consume will be books, the occasional quality video game, and Hacker News (in moderation).

1.  Relentlessly pursue my passions.

    I consider myself really lucky to have found my passions this year: design, photography, and cooking. I treat writing more as a coping mechanism than a passion, and publishing can be a way to highlight some of things I learn along the way.

1.  Read more as a matter of personal principle.

    Finishing a book every week has been on the top of my mind for a while, and my reading list can easily accommodate such a challenge, but maybe this year is the year it'll come to fruition. We'll see.

1.  Happiness comes from doing meaningful work in the right roles.

    I thank yerdle for helping me discover what kind of work environment makes me tick---I'm excited for the new opportunity I'm taking on next year, but more on that in a future post.

1.  The secret to saving money and feeling better is cooking more.

    Having a more direct, personal relationship to food has made me a more appreciative, healthier person in general. It helps that cooking is a hobby from which I derive tremendous enjoyment. Making food is such a delightfully creative craft that I can't wait to spend more time in the kitchen cooking up a storm. Plus, you save by eating in.

1.  Lead a healthy lifestyle by being diligent about sleep, exercise, and diet.

    Sleep, exercise, and diet are the three most important determinants to my basic level of happiness on a daily basis. When I respect my body and take care of its needs with diligence, the gains in productivity and state of mind are incredible.

1.  Only buy things with which I can create value.

    I own very little, and I intend to keep it that way for as long as I live. One of the cardinal rules I impose on my own purchasing behavior is that the item I'm buying has to be able to create value in some way; for example, a good pen fits the bill but a television set doesn't.

1.  It's okay to cut loose the toxic people in my life.

    I lost two really good friends to altercations about money this year. Don't be afraid to sever ties with the bad influences in your life, because the company with whom you surround yourself ultimately shapes the kind of person you are. I've simplified the list of traits I admire in people down to three: integrity, authenticity, and empathy.

1.  Cherish the company I've chosen to keep and let them know.

    Too often in the past I've lamented not keeping in contact with all the wonderful people who have touched my life in some meaningful way. I've met tons of talented peers and inspiring mentors this past year, and I'm committing to cultivating these relationships, because I know some of them will become so much more. I have a saying: good company trumps all.

1.  Do a startup for the right reason with the right people.

    This is written on a post-it note I keep on my desk---you don't want to learn this the hard way like I did.

1.  Spend more time documenting my life here.

    Frank Chimero's resolve to [double down on his personal site](http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/12/homesteading-2014/) captures perfectly my thoughts on the state of self-expression on the web, and my own endeavors to create a fuller, more personal portrait of myself online.

1.  Become a more interesting person.

    It pays to be an interesting person, because everyone enjoys meeting interesting people. That said, I would not want to hang out with the person I am now. Do everything above and maybe by next year's end I'll grab a beer or two with myself.

Have a wonderful new year.
