The thing about rock bottom is that it’s easy to get there.

It creeps on you, like a silent disease without symptoms; it’s hard to diagnose and the prognosis often comes too late. Hitting rock bottom isn’t a definitive event marked by a timestamp. Oftentimes when it rears its ugly head it’s already too late, because—fucking surprise!—you’re right smack in the thick of it. You find it harder and harder to get up in the morning, time seems to fly by without your participation, and the number of days in which you wear pants fast approaches zero. It renders you, as I summarized for those who ask how I was at the time, a tremendously useless piece of shit.

The thing about rock bottom is that there are innumerable ways to get there.

It happened this time because I haven’t fully recovered from my breakup with Y Combinator and the startup. Coming to terms with it was hampered by a Facebook feed filled with the frenzy of Demo Day from former batchmates. Even knowing that it was ultimately the right decision to leave, it was hard not to feel dejected about the experience as a consequence. Failure, or at least feelings of failure, is a time-tested, well-traversed shortcut to rock bottom. (Not to say there aren’t others, because there are too many to count.)

The thing about rock bottom is that it sucks. A lot.

Taking the fast track to rock bottom isn’t generally a self-conscious choice, so when life decides to take you on a detour there it’s usually with a sense of impending dread and doom that never fully manifests itself until you’ve arrived. We don’t ask *“Are we there yet?”* when we head for the bottom so much as *“When is it over?”* becomes the overhanging question of the day, every single day, until by some miraculous measure of time we slowly dig ourselves out of the all-consuming darkness at the bottom.

The thing about rock bottom is that it has to get better.

It has to get better because, in your own solipsistic reality, you're already at the bottom, and the only way is up. In my experience rock bottom isn’t a pit from which other people can help you climb, but the bright side is that it seems to eventually get easier to scale with time. Being on the bottom often forces perspective on us at the expense of our ego. It helps us find and discover what really matters. It’s humbling, because it challenges our resolve and character when we’re at our weakest. It may be hard, made more deceptively so because of the soul-crushing spell it could cast on our psyche. It may seem impossible, and that may very well be true, but it’s worth keeping in mind that a well-endeavored life is by nature fraught with lows and highs, the former giving cause for the latter’s celebration. The important thing to realize is that given enough time and with some luck, rock bottom becomes an opportunity to reinvent yourself and to start anew.

**The thing about rock bottom is that, for most of us, it’s never really rock bottom.**

It'll get better. I’m starting to see things more clearly again. I’ve regained control of my sleeping schedule. I’ve internalized the YC chapter as a hard lesson in finding and working with the right people and even begun chipping away at a few side projects. I’ve assuaged feelings of restlessness and loneliness with a long list of inspiring and insightful books. I’ve gained a newfound perspective on time when it comes to finishing things that matter. I’ve even found an inner calmness that has eluded me for years chasing startup dreams and misguided definitions of success. It just took some time.

Granted, it’s unfortunate that I will neither regain nor cherish all that time I’ve spent in [Rock Bottom](http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Bottom), but in retrospect perhaps it was time worth spending, if only for what comes after.

There was a quote by [U.S. General George Patton](http://www.generalpatton.com/) that carried me through high school when the going got tough, and it serves equally well as a reminder today:

> Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom.
