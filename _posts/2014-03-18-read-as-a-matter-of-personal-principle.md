In times of distress and periods of uncertainty, when the night sky of my mind is cloudy, nary a star in sight and devoid of any clarity, I tend to turn to the wisdom of quotations imparted by those much wiser than me. We all stand upon the shoulders of giants, after all. But the most poignant quote I've stumbled upon of late came from a commencement speech an English high school teacher by the name of David McCullough Jr. gave to Wellesley High's graduating class in 2012.

> As you commence, then, and before you scatter to the winds, I urge you to do whatever you do for no reason other than you love it and believe in its importance. Don't bother with work you don't believe in any more than you would a spouse you're not crazy about, lest you too find yourself on the wrong side of a Baltimore Orioles comparison. Resist the easy comforts of complacency, the specious glitter of materialism, the narcotic paralysis of self-satisfaction. Be worthy of your advantages. And read... read all the time... read as a matter of principle, as a matter of self-respect. Read as a nourishing staple of life. Develop and protect a moral sensibility and demonstrate the character to apply it. Dream big. Work hard. Think for yourself. Love everything you love, everyone you love, with all your might. And do so, please, with a sense of urgency, for every tick of the clock subtracts from fewer and fewer; and as surely as there are commencements there are cessations, and you'll be in no condition to enjoy the ceremony attendant to that eventuality no matter how delightful the afternoon.

This is only a snippet of the entire speech, which [you can read in its entirety here](http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/wellesley/2012/06/youre_not_special_teacher_tell.html). Pundits might say it's overtly flowery, perhaps even moreso in context of the utter insignificance (in my humble opinion) of a high school graduation, but this speech was about the most riveting peptalk for life I've ever read. In particular, the part about reading immediately stuck to my head like cats to screen doors.

> And read... read all the time... read as a matter of principle, as a matter of self-respect. Read as a nourishing staple of life.

Reading has always been a strong tendency of mine since I was a kid, and it's offered me respite and solace in times when life has led me astray more times than I'd care to remember. As I grew older, as the demands and the obligations of life grew in proportion to my list of books to read, the time I set aside for reading gradually approached zero.

You might read when you're on the Internet, but I'm talking about substantive reading, the act of picking up an actual book and sinking your teeth into her words and getting lost in between her pages. Not, as so many of us find ourselves these days, thumbing through our Twitter and Facebook streams and glazing over the occasional linkbait article and dumping more insubstantial and fleeting news onto the information landfill that has become our brain.

It's been a long time coming, but I want to cultivate a better reading habit starting from now. I want it to be something I do everyday, something for which I make time even if I don't have time, something that helps me think and recompose and become a better person, something that's instilled in my identity as a defining personal principle.

Every Wednesday starting this week I plan to finish a book and write about it here. It'll be a commitment I intend to keep indefinitely, but my milestone will be 52 books in a year. I'll also syndicate the book reviews to a Medium collection I created to curate books worth reading, aptly named [Books Worth Reading](https://medium.com/books-worth-reading). If you choose to undertake the same challenge, be sure to add and share your books there as well.

To weave into this post my excitement for the upcoming season of Game of Thrones, I leave you with this quote from George R.R. Martin in *A Dance with Dragons*:

> A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.
