<p class="intro">We celebrated Thanksgiving a day early this year, since Jason was spending turkey day with his family in Texas. Andrew led the charge in the kitchen, and remained the only fighing warrior as he single-handedly commandeered the turkey into warm, succulent poultry, the gravy into fatty goodness, the mashed potatoes into smooth, silky mouthfeel, the macaroni and cheese into rich delight. We had a few guests over, and after the amazing feast conjured by our roommate who more than made his home state of North Carolina proud, there was debauchery of the beer pong variety, and the rest, as they say on this particular day of thanks, was history.</p>
