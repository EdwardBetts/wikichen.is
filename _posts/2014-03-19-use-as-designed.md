In a press conference following the debacle of the iPhone 4's reception-blocking antenna problem, cheekily dubbed "Antennagate" by frenzied media and indignant consumers, Steve Jobs announced onstage that Apple would be giving away free bumper cases to iPhone 4 owners.

It was clearly an appeasement to the general public and far from an admission of guilt on Apple's part. And if you ask me, the whole thing was blown way out of proportion, disappointing as it was to find out that a product crafted by Apple could be faulty by design (if not for a lack of foresight then a lack of empathy accounting for edge cases in user behavior).

But the compromise they offered consumers brought up an interesting observation that never quite absolved Apple: for the iPhone 4 users who purchased the device without prior intention of using a case, it wasn't much of a comprimising solution that they would now have to use their device with what amounts to be the software equivalent of a patch. Unlike software, however, hardware patches aren't beneath the surface and inconspicuous; you're essentially using a different product than its designers had intended.

During the Q&A following the press conference when asked if they themselves used the bumper cases, Steve Jobs and his fellow execs sheepishly held up their case-free iPhone 4's. And why would they? The cases tarnished the meticulously engineered and well-designed form of the iPhone 4; they detracted from the vision that was designed and assembled and advertised and sold. Sure, it could have been a company statement, but no one is going to argue that an iPhone stuffed inside an OtterBox case looks better than a vanilla one.

The proliferation of accessorized devices today is a perverse trend and a personal affront to all that is beautiful and functional. There is delight in using products as they are designed, in suppressing undesirable economical motives to protect and mummify our devices, in allowing the product to breathe in its natural form and articulate what works and what doesn't to the users who choose to bring it into their lives.

For this reason I never buy protective accessories for my electronics, and it's  helped me learn about what constitutes truly great products and appreciate the better designed things that I use on a daily basis.

A well-designed device takes into account its intended user and their behavior. A device that doesn't account for clumsy human behavior is poorly designed. In that sense, the iPhones with glass backs are poorly designed products. It  shouldn't take three broken phones for me to realize that glass is a piss poor material for a mobile phone.

We use the mobile phone more as a detachable extension of our arm than a stationary accessory like pair of glasses or a watch. It's prone to the variables and uncertainties of our own locomotion and the accompanying activities and actions we engage in. It should be able to withstand the short falls and stumbles that come with the occasional slips in our mobility, but iPhones with cracked screens commonly spotted in the wild prove to the contrary. Other manufacturers who follow suit and copy this form-follows-function design paradigm are similarly shortsighted: my Nexus 4 suffered the same shattered fate on an otherwise uneventful evening jog.

I also understand that there is much psychology at work underlying people's desire to shrink wrap their devices that is a direct function of their price. It follows that the decision to price a poorly designed device at a premium is an irresponsible one. The same pitfall has kept me from buying an unsubsidized iPhone 5 for development purposes, because the premium price hardly justifies how easy it is to damage the phone without spending even more on unflattering protective accessories. In this sense, an aesthetically beautiful device isn't necessarily a functionally beautiful one. In my view, the latter wins every time.

There are two devices I use everyday I would consider functionally beautiful. The first is my Nexus 5, an unassuming Android smartphone that eschews the glass back popular on competitors with a white polycarbonate shell. I'm by no means a klutz, but it's suffered a fair share of drops and scrapes, and it still looks as good as the day I opened it. The second is my Kindle Paperwhite, an e-reader I carry around with me almost everywhere I go, stuffed in pockets and backpacks and tossed about recklessly; it too has beautifully survived my indiscriminate abuse.

Both of these devices seem to be designed with a human being as the user in mind, opting for the pragmatic instead of the flashy, for solid construction instead of brittle novelty. They also aren't so ludicrously priced that I would feel, like so many others who worship at the fruity altar, a financial obligation to shield them from the world and from the rough edges in my life. I spend less time worrying about how they hold up and more time actually using them as designed.

A good product should fit into your life, not the other way around. If they're well-designed products, they'll adapt to and embrace your idiosyncrasies with a fond resilience, and you'll be a more conscientious and appreciative consumer for it.
