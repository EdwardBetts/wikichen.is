[Priceonomics](http://priceonomics.com/), an online price guide for just about any commercial product you can imagine, maintains what is arguably the best product blog I've ever read from a startup or otherwise.

With content published almost daily spanning from [marketing case studies][marketing] and [insane rental markets][rental] to the [psychology of appearances][psych] and [Japanese toilets][toilets], Priceonomics offers a prolific source of in-depth knowledge on interesting topics that cater to all types of audiences (and more distinctively, still relates to the product it sells).

Priceonomics hires [its own writer][writer], which is unusual for a startup its size. The conventional entrepreneurial wisdom holds that startups should stay lean, and if the product is technological in nature, focus on a strong engineering founding team. But what is increasingly preached and accepted in product development circles is a proactive approach to marketing your products at the same time that you're building them. It's an approach the guys at Priceonomics have capitalized on for their product: market by creating content people care about.

As demonstrated by Priceonomics, an *active* blog is a great way to drive organic traffic to your site. In the past year I've found myself at Priceonomics through links shared on social media sites more than any other company I could recall. Even if I don't use their product, there's already a strong brand association established, that Priceonomics produces stellar blog posts and knows what they're talking about. If I'm ever looking for an online price guide, guess where I'll go first? Or if my friends ask me for a referral, guess who I'll recommend?

Should your startup have a blog? Pete Warden [offers an insightful answer][answer] on his:

> The short answer is, you probably shouldn't have one! It takes a lot of time and mental energy to keep an active blog going, and if you spent that time on external consulting instead and channeled the revenue into AdWords you'd almost certainly get more traffic for your effort. If you don't have a burning desire to say something, you'll get dispirited by the initial lack of interest and give up.

> It's a bit like choosing to do a startup instead of sticking with a salary job â€“ if you stare at the cold probabilities it's an irrational choice. You hear about the successes, but not about about the hundreds of other blogs that get ignored despite great content.

The important takeaway is this: a blog with great writing, that which appeals to the pathos and seeks to genuinely inform and educate an audience, is a powerful way to build your brand and and to increase awareness for your product.
