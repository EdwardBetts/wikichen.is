I wanted to like this book, I really did. But not only did getting to the end of this book cement my impression of Tim Ferriss as one of the most insufferable human beings in mankind's existence, his wide-eyed, haphazard, and misguided prance into the world of food marks a true travesty in culinary history. The book is less about actually imparting any practical cooking advice for the amateur as it is about six hundred or so painfully staged pages of Tim Ferris' research into the obscure and the unaccessible, a brag book of sorts as he tosses about uninspired recipes, irrelevant anecdotes, and his self-serving exploits in the face of the unassuming reader, who was promised a progressive, realistic guide to the oft formidable world of food preparation. No, don't even get me started on the *learning about how to learn through cooking* fluff. It's bullshit.

If Gordon Ramsay's *Ultimate Cookery Course* is laughably flawed because of how detached the acclaimed chef is from the realities of the common kitchen, *The 4-Hour Chef* is tragically doomed from its first page because it lacked the one ingredient a great teaching manual needs: **passion**. (I would argue that the other essential ingredient is empathy, something Ferris' diet-obsessed, soulless fanaticism for nutrition also wholly lacks.) Here is a man who thought it amusing if he codified a learning construct around the discipline of culinary arts for no other sake than the novelty. There are better books and online resources if you want to learn how to cook, as you don't need to read far to realize Ferriss cleary wrote *The 4-Hour Chef* not for you, but for himself.
