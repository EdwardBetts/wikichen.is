## Tips for Eating Out

* Most seafood sold on Monday is about four to five days old.
* Don't eat mussels in restaurants unless you know the chef personally or have seen how they store and hold their mussels for service.
* Brunch menus "are an open invitation to the cost-conscious chef, a dumping ground for the odd bits left over from Friday and Saturday nights or for the scraps generated in the normal course of business."
* Bacteria love hollandaise.
* Cooks hate brunch, so the best line cooks usually work on Friday and Saturday nights.
* The reuse of bread is pervasive in the food service industry. It's okay to eat it. Eat the bread.
* Do judge a restaurant by its bathroom. Bathrooms are easy to clean; kitchens are not.
* You're going to have a bad time if you order your meats well-done, because that's how chefs save on cost by serving you bad cuts, hence the tradition of "saving for well-done."
* Vegetarians and vegans are "a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn." Amen.
* Chickens are dirty, and chefs see it as a menu item for people who don't know what they want to eat.
* Look to the waiter to identify what's good or bad on the menu. He could save your life with a raised eyebrow or sigh.
* Watchwords for fine dining: Tuesday through Saturday, busy, turnover, rotation. Order seafood on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
* Bourdain's words to live by: you only go around once. Try everything. #YOGO

## Tips for Cooking

* One good chef's knife that fits comfortably in your hand is all you need in the knife department. He recommends lightweight, easy-to-sharpen, and relatively inexpensive vanadium steel Global knives.
* For tips on how to handle a knife, check out Jacques Pepin's *La Technique*.
* A thin bottomed saucepan is useless for anything. A non-stick saute pan is essential. Never wash it, simply wipe it clean after each use, don't use metal in it, don't scratch it.
* Shallots are an essential ingredient to making food taste great in restaurants.
* Butter, and lots of it, are what restaurants use to make everything taste richer and creamier and mellower.
* Garlic is divine.
* Stock is the backbone of good cooking.
* Demi-glace is the ingredient of culinary conquerors.
* You should garnish your food, because it takes so little to elevate an otherwise ordinary-looking plate and it takes zero talent.
* Good food is most often simple food.
