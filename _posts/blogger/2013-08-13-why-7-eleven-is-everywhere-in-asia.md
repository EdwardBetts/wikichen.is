If you've ever found yourself in an urban part of Asia, chances are you'll come across 7-Eleven stores nearly everywhere you go. The ubiquity of these chain convenience stores on street corners has been a subject of much personal curiosity since I was a kid growing up in Taiwan, so I'm actually going to set aside some time today to lay down some groundwork on answering this seemingly trite inquiry: just why are there so many 7-Elevens in Asia compared to the rest of the world?

Walk into any 7-Eleven store in Taiwan and you're immediately hit with sensory overload. The blast of cool air from the store's AC hits your face at the same time as the distinctive smell: a mix of tea leaf eggs and assorted eats from the hotpot section of the store and that unique 7-Eleven store fragrance reeking of packaged foods. Your eyes try to make sense of the shelves upon shelves of items you'll never have time to browse one by one. The layouts of these 7-Eleven stores are near identical: clean and organized, minimally structured to showcase the goods. Some have even begun to add a table counter with stools for your more leisurely morning trips to the store.

A new 7-Eleven opens every two hours somewhere in the world.

The stores are so ubiquitous in Taiwan that the Taiwanese government [collaborated with 7-Eleven][collab] to provide the public with free health checkups. It's not uncommon to come across intersections in Taipei where [two or three 7-Eleven stores stand across from each other][intersect]. With a population of about 23 million and over 4,830 stores, Taiwan has the highest per capita number of these 24/7 outlets.

There are more 7-Eleven licensed stores than McDonald's at more than 50,000. Spanning 16 countries, the largest market is actually Japan, where close to 30% of all 7-Eleven outlets are located (around 15,000) and where, quite appropriately, 7-Eleven's worldwide operations are headquartered.

The company was founded in 1927 in Dallas, Texas, operating convenience stores in various parts of the United States then called "Tot'em Stores" because customers would "tote" away their purchased goods. It was only after WWII that the name was changed to 7-Eleven. Through a tumultous history rife with financial challenges, 7-Eleven and its parent holding company Southland Corporation was rescued in 1998 from bankrupty by its largest franchisee, a japanese company called Ito-Yokado, which later became what is now known as Seven & I Holdings Co., who acquired 7-Eleven as its subsidiary in 2005.

Corporate history partly explains 7-Eleven's tremendous market penetration in Asia, but their success can also be largely attributed to an ingenious business model and franchise format capitalizing on the value of convenience. It's capitalistic consumerism writ large.

Almost all 7-Elevens in the world, be it the United States or Japan, are operated by franchisees, who are encouraged to tailor their outlets to the local demographics and tastes. Torsten Stocker, a China-based partner at strategy consulting firm Monitor Group, [praises the forward-thinking business model][model] under the guise of an unconventional localization strategy. "\[7-Eleven\] has local partners who understand the environment in their market very well," he stated in an email. "This allows them to grow very rapidly and at much lower investment."

To help its franchisees align with the brand, 7-Eleven sends out consultants twice a week, who are issued a propietary data-analysis tool called the Retail Information System that allows store owners to track what products are selling in real time. Introduced in Japan, the RIS allows 7-Eleven to spot sales trends and take advantage of consumer purchasing behavior more quickly than its competitors. It offers them a statistical advantage in what was a fairly saturated market for convenience stores that to this day helps reassert their market dominance.

But 7-Eleven's success in Asia may very well be a fortuitous coincidence, one engendered by geographical constraints and cultural attitudes. The convenience store model works largely in Asia because populations are so densely packed in urban settings there. Consumers in Asia are also accustomed to shopping at smaller vendor units who sell at smaller quantities, whereas their American counterparts tend to buy in bulk.

It remains to be seen if 7-Eleven can overcome these barriers to achieve market penetration elsewhere, in light of its recent plans to rapidly expand in parts of the United States, such as Manhattan and Portland. The chain has already seen resistance [from lovers of New York City bodegas][bodegas] threatened by its Slurpee slinging franchisees.

Regardless of its presence in the rest of the world, 7-Eleven is a commercial force to be reckoned with throughout most of Asia, and it's unlikely that will change anytime soon. I get this funny feeling, walking around in the streets of Taiwan, and bumping into the inevitable convenience store lit by its iconic green logo, having to acknowledge this magical little store stuffed with an endless inventory of things to be a cultural fixture in the urban landscape.

Is it a good or a bad thing? Only time can tell. For now, at half past three in the morning, I'm happy that I can simply walk half a block down the street to cure my late night munchies.
