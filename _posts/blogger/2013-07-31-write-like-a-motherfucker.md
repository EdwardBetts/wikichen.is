I’m challenging myself to write everyday for a year, or 365 days. The experiment will start tomorrow on August 1, 2013, and end on August 1, 2014. That means tomorrow of next year, I should have at least 365 posts on this blog, and hopefully in a mad dash to finish the very last one.

Why, you may be asking, am I committing myself to such a seemingly time-consuming daily exercise for such a long duration?

Primarily because I love writing. I've written for as long as I can remember: short stories of Chinese tales and lore I grew up with (see: [the Monkey King][monkey]), nauseatingly verbose love letters in my adolescence (which thankfully got me laid quite a few times), your typical academic essays spanning literature analysis and social studies (from which I derived much enjoyment, to be completely honest), and a trail of dead if not inactive blogs marking different stages and phases of my life (e.g., there was one written entirely in Chinese).

But I've stopped writing since college, and I have a nagging suspicion that a substantial source of discontent with my status quo stems from a prolonged detachment from my written voice. This is an attempt to rediscover the joy I once found in my own written word, when putting my thoughts to paper came as easily as eating or breathing. In explicitly setting a hard constraint of a year, I hope that writing would naturally develop into a habit I pick up in life even beyond the scope of this challenge.

The underlying motivation, however, is my growing desire to be a better writer. No other skill has proven so useful in my life than the ability to externalize my thoughts and opinions and to articulate my perspective and platform. It's a shame writing has fallen on the wayside on my list of priorities, but no more—this challenge is as much a commitment to my artistic betterment as it is a proclamation for my love of writing.

It brings to mind what [Raymond Chandler][raymond], one of my favorite authors, said about his craft and his process.

> I am a writer, and there comes a time when that which I write has to belong to me, has to be written alone and in silence, with no one looking over my shoulder, no one telling me a better way to write it. It doesn't have to be great writing, it doesn't even have to be terribly good. It just has to be mine.

In honing my writing, I also want to become a better thinker. Reserving a block of time everyday to write about things that matter to me seems like a great way to encourage opportunities for self-reflection and discovery. To that end, I've also created a set of criteria to follow during the course of this project.

## Each post must be published on this site.

I'm a firm believer in content ownership, because most publishing platforms (I'm looking at you, [Medium][medium]) subvert ownership to the extent that creative freedom and identity are lost. In addition, I want complete control over how I publish and use my content and how my readers will access and read it. If you're serious about finding an audience and creating a brand with your writing, there's no excuse not to self-publish on your own site.

## The minimum word count for each post is 300.

Establishing a constraint helps me measure my progress and frame the task in a less daunting light. 300 words are plenty enough to flesh out a thought and at the same time not so many that I would feel intimidated to produce everyday. Eventually, I want to be able to churn out double that on a daily basis, but as with all lofty undertakings in life, first baby steps, then we'll see where it goes.

## The post must include a reference to or cite at least one external source.

Writing in isolation doesn't offer much room to grow as a writer, especially in a day and age where new information and knowledge are so readily accessible. A great writer makes insightful connections and observations between different bodies of writing, and I want to develop the kind of analytical thinking capable of discerning the bigger picture and connecting the dots.

This is an experiment to test the hypothesis that [quality is derived from quantity][q1], that [practice makes perfect][q2], and that [perseverance engenders success][q3]. It won't be an easy road, but now that the trail is laid out, I have no excuse but to go and to prove myself.

Perhaps [Sugar from The Rumpus][sugar] explains it more eloquently just why I'm so motivated to write:

> We get the work done on the ground level. And the kindest thing I can do for you is to tell you to get your ass on the floor. I know it’s hard to write, darling. But it’s harder not to. The only way you’ll find out if you “have it in you” is to get to work and see if you do. The only way to override your “limitations, insecurities, jealousies, and ineptitude” is to produce.
