A trip to Taiwan is a full-on assault on your senses.

Stepping out into the open air, your skin immediately becomes clammy with the intense humidity. It's unpleasant, almost suffocating, and in less than half an hour you will be drenched in your own perspiration. You wonder how anyone gets anything done here, but somehow life goes on and the people carry on.

There are scooters everywhereâ€”on the road and parked in front of stores, spilling onto the streets. You notice that the streets are narrow, the buildings so tightly packed there is barely any space, if any, separating them. And the signs, they're everywhere, stacked on top and beside each other, jutting out of the walls of buildings like weeds unchecked and growing out of control.

Life in the city is a noisy, busy existence. Fleets of scooters and mopeds deafen the streets with their droning engines, and the constant flow of automobile and foot traffic alike make the streets seem smaller than they already are. There are people everywhere, signaling a vibrant sign of life, but maybe too much so.

Here the stores open out into the streets. In a single block you spot no less than a dozen restaurants and food stands, mixed with an assorted array of local businesses ranging from health clinics and bike shops to electronic stores and name brand clothing stores. In every direction this arrangement repeats itself. Wait, is that a 7-Eleven not even half a block from another 7-Eleven? You'll see another dozen before venturing out of the city.

At night, the labyrinthic grid of streets are brilliantly lit by the high hanging signs of their stores, creating a dazzling effect as if you were transported to an alternate neon wonderland.

There's a beautiful, scenic side to Taiwan as well. The mountains and the beaches and the lakes offer incomprable refuge for those seeking respite from the hustle and bustle of urban life.

Taiwan is an island with a culture heavily influenced by the Chinese ghosts of its past and the forces of globalization from the West. It struggles with an identity split between preserving traditions while embracing modernity in the 21st century. But perhaps more importantly, it's a place with fantastic foods, natural views, friendly people, and a palpable sense of cultural pride with an eye towards the future. It's a place I called home for more than twelve years, and I can't recommend it enough for those who travel to expand their horizons.
