One noticeable part of American culture that baffled me when I first moved to the United States was how dishes or entrees weren't shared between members of a party eating together. In most Chinese households, meals are often structured in a way such that entrees are placed in the middle of the table and everyone shares from the central array of food.

This cultural dinner procedure makes for much better social dynamics during meals, because every member of the party is knowingly and actively sharing the same food, promoting a sense of togetherness and mutual engagement. It's why most Chinese restaurants have circular tables, and sometimes ones with a rotating platform in the center to facilitate passing the dishes.

Sharing and eating around the same food makes for a much better social dining experience. For me, recounting meals with friends and family is enhanced by the fact that everyone was eating *together*. The photos below were some of my favorite meals in Taiwan.

Aside: I just want to give a shoutout to guava, one of my favorite fruits whose absolute deliciousness seems not to have caught on across the Pacific. My favorite way of eating guava is to cut out the seedy portion and dab the slices in some plum powder. So good.
