> Thiel’s law: A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.
>
> --- Peter Thiel in *[Blake Master's CS183 Notes](http://blakemasters.com/post/21742864570/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-6-notes-essay)*

For the past month my life has been mired in a special kind of hell, that of apartment hunting, which to those unfamiliar, involves painfully crawling through craigslist every morning, copy-and-pasting a boilerplate inquiry into an email and sending several dozen off into the digital abyss, arranging viewing appointments from those who do reply, setting aside an entire day to see them one by one, and pray, with every last bit of energy I could muster, that one of the good ones will pick me and this the last time I'll ever need to go through this godforsaken ordeal.

It feels eerily similar: just last December I was planning my move to North Carolina (I know, of all places), and this past summer my now defunct startup needed to move closer to the city. In every instance it was a pain in the ass, and it's a needless, soul-sucking distraction when you just want to get some good work done.

But you know what? It feels different this time; it's the same unpleasant process in the same context of a startup relocating elsewhere, but there was no question that I would bear the responsibility of the task, knowing I'm the one with most know-how to get the job done. And I did it knowing that when it comes to the next step, or another equally urgent but messy matter in the future, that someone trustworthy and dependable has my back. There is trust where there was uncertainty, and there is a mutual understanding that we can always count on each other to clean up the shit, no questions asked.

Maybe that's why I know this could work out better than any venture I've ever been involved with, and it's going to work because this time I'll have my best friend.

## The Right People

> Good relationships amongst founders tend to drive a company’s success. The question of the founding team is thus the single most important question in assessing an early startup.

I first met Varun Arora in my junior and last year at Carnegie Mellon, when I oversaw the first incarnation of Tartan House---a former frat house the administration converted into a makeshift dorm for the unwitting leftovers from the campus housing pool---as her resident advisor. It was a ragtag bunch of international misfits and Greek outcasts, and we had ourselves a great time. Varun's room was right next to mine, and we quickly bonded over discussions spanning startup culture, the social impact of technology, his mistifying cult of frugal vegetarianism, and the dark, shivering pit of despair that was Pittsburgh.

Varun is one of the best people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing; he's the rare type of individual who exudes authenticity and humility when you speak to him at any moment. But most importantly, above all the heuristics one uses to judge others, he's the most *decent* person I know, a decency more or less defined by a combination of integrity, empathy, and genuineness. And in this day and age, decency---the most honest, humble, no bullshit kind---is awfully hard to find in people. Just by being around him I feel like a better person, and I'm proud and happy to call him my best friend.

It's refreshing to be around someone who lives to brighten other people's day (or at least tries when he ad-libs hilariously unfunny puns) and who constantly strives to make a meaningful difference in the world, even if that entails a life of the most meager means. When I first read Paul Graham's essay [on the one trait good startup founders have](http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html), Varun was the one who jumped to mind---he is *relentlessly resourceful* personified. I've watched him build his nonprofit from next to nothing over the years, and the passion and conviction with which he weilds over seemingly insurmountable odds never cease to amaze me.

I've wanted to work with Varun for as long as I've known him, but as with most missed opportunities in life (or so we like to tell ourselves), the timing was never right.

## The Right Reason

> In this calculus, one factor dominates all others. That factor is whether the founders are aligned with each other. This is key both in terms of structure and company culture. If the founders are in sync, you can move on to the rest of the equation. But if they aren’t, it will blow up the company. Nothing will work.

To be honest, I don't know what Varun sees in me. I'm hopelessly reckless and irrationally stubborn and completely clueless about how, if my borderline sociopathic behavior doesn't pose too much of a problem, I'm ever going to contribute to this grand society given I haven't exactly figured out what it is I want to do yet. And this might all just be the biggest mistake he'll ever make, bringing aboard a ticking time-bomb on an otherwise slow but steady track to tremendous success.

Maybe there's a certain appeal to my methods, the wild abandonment with which I seize and deconstruct opportunities, the uncompromising drive to "do well while doing good", the blinding appetite for finding and solving problems that actually matter. We're two very different people with very different personalities, yet we seem to align on what matters, what's important to us, and the kind of impact we want to impart on the world---and maybe that's the magic sauce for great teams they talk so much about.

The mission for OpenCurriculum is to democratize locally relevant educational content. In Varun's vision, every child in the world deserves access to high quality primary education. The actual founding story warrants a separate post in its own right, but the point is that I firmly believed in what he was doing and that he was certainly among the few who could make it happen. After all, most great success stories started as lofty dreams, and what part of entrepreneurship isn't ridiculous enough already?

When Varun got accepted into Y Combinator (a wise decision on their part), he approached me about joining OpenCurriculum to lead product. There was never really an answer other than "oh fuck yes hug me now", at least not for me, and not just because I get to work with my best friend, but because I get to work with my best friend *on something that matters*.

I don't know what the future holds for us. This whole thing might fail spectacularly because I'm just the worst, my obsessive compulsive need to clean everything might trigger Varun's latent homocidal tendencies, or the whole world might be taken over by dolphins who ultimately decide to abolish education for all mankind.

All I know is that I'm going to work my ass off and have as much fun as I can while this lasts, and if Lady Luck is on our side, for a long time to come.

So yeah. I've gone off on several tangents, but here's what you probably wanted to know when you first got here: I'm joining OpenCurriculum to work with my best friend Varun to democratize education. We're going to be in Mountain View for the next three months undergoing Y Combinator. I'm scared shitless, but it's going to be awesome.

Here's a picture of Varun and me at the Silicon Valley campus of CMU:
