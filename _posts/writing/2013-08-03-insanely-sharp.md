The new Nexus 7 is a beautiful machine. I've been using it as my primary mobile device for the last week or so, and oh boy, has Google exceeded my expectations with the latest update of their 7" tablet.

[Impressive hardware specs][specs] aside, the thing that really stands out is the screen. Oh, the stunningly gorgeous, deliciously crisp screen. At 323 pixels per inch, it's one of the most impressive (if not the best) tablet displays on the market. Text has never looked sharper and letters more defined, movies play back in beautiful native 1080p, and more strkingly, everything just *feels* better.

The experience of using the 1920x1200 screen on a 7" form factor is certainly one missing from Apple's tablet lineup, and I find myself describing the Nexus 7's display to others with vocabulary I often associate with Apple products.

It's *insanely sharp*.

One has to wonder if there's a shifting trend at work here.

Google has always played catch up to Apple in the mobile space. But at its current pace, it's becoming increasingly clear that Google is getting better at making hardware faster than Apple is at making software. And the search giant already has the superior software stack to back up its mobile devices.

This trend is reflected in my mobile device history. My first smartphone was an HTC Magic running Android 2.2 Froyo given away at the second Google I/O conference. When a cheaper, subsidized iPhone 3GS came along, I jumped at the chance to join the iOS bandwagon. The honeymoon lasted through the iPhone 4 refresh cycle, but by the time the Galaxy Nexus came around I decided that Android, now mature and equally usable, would be worth trying again. The app selection might be lacking, but as a mobile OS Android offered an unprecedented level of control and convenience, and even moreso now as Google continues to take advantage of its software edge (see: [Google Now vs. Siri][vs]). Google's own services like Voice and Maps are so much better on Android than anywhere else that, at least for me, iOS makes better electronic toys than personal devices.

It's not hard to fathom a world near the future where Google makes better devices than Apple. Android app downloads are [beating iOS for the first time][downloads]. Motorola, now under Google's mobile arm, recently [introduced Moto X][moto], their first time building hardware for Google since their acquisition (edit: the implication here being that Google's own line of devices will continue to get better over time).

The new Nexus 7 is a glowing showcase of Google's impressive progress on the mobile front, a testament to its refocused efforts to integrate software with hardware. In another five years maybe, just maybe, it's Google who will live up to Apple's bar for quality: *insanely great*.
