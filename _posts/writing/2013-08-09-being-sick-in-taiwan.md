For the past few days I've been fighting a stomach flu that more than put a damper on my trip back to Taiwan. The erratic bowel movements started the morning we made our way to [Sun Moon Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Moon_Lake), a scenic water destination for locals and tourists alike. By sundown I had fallen so ill I couldn't make it through dinner, and by night my condition took on a more feverish note, making doing anything, least of all write my daily blog posts, impossible.

The family trip ended prematurely when it was obvious my flu wasn't going to get better soon, and since then I've been to two clinics for diagnosis and medication.

Having been accustomed to the (rather dysfunctional) healthcare system in the United States, I was more than surprised to find out that the total cost of the two clinical consultations, both of which included on-the-spot prescription drugs and one with intraveous therapy, was less than $30 USD. And the bill was considered relatively high because I wasn't on insurance and had to pay out of pocket. The receptionist even sounded apologetic.

Since 1995, Taiwan's 23 million citizens have enjoyed universal and comprehensive health insurance coverage under its single-payer [National Health Insurance][nhi] plan. To use an easy analogy for those back home, imagine if Medicare, which is subsidized by the U.S. government for the elderly, were extended to the entire population. NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer, with the working class paying a premium split with their employers and others a flat rate with governmental aid. This means that unlike the system from which it drew inspiration, the NHI makes it very easy for its citizens to pay back medical bills.

It may be that my long absence from Taiwan has lowered my immune system to its less than friendly summers (and so explains this most inconvenient flu), but I'm sure as hell glad I got sick somewhere with such a supportive, affordable healthcare system.
