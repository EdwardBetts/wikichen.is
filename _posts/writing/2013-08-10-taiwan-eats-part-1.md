Despite a nasty stomach bug putting me out of commission for the better part of my trip to Taiwan, I still had a chance to sample many of the local delicacies I grew up with and loved. The food remains my favorite aspect of revisiting Taiwan, so allow me to take you on a gastronomic journey through the streets of my hometown Tainan.

</div>

Salty porridge (鹹粥) is part of a hearty Taiwanese breakfast. Slightly ground up fish is mixed with rice porridge in a clear broth and served with a side of youtiao, also known as Chinese doughnut. The combination of salty fish parts and the rice soup help jumpstart your taste buds and curb your morning appetite without being overbearing, getting your body ready for the day.

</div>

For lunch, enjoy a bowl of fish stew with noodles (魚羹麵) and a side of fried chicken cutlets. The transparent stew has a peculiar consistency akin to that of a watered down clam chowder, which usually throws off those less accustomed to the Asian palette. It has a sweet and slightly sour mouthfeel, which bring flavor to the accompanying balls of minced fish that are relatively tasteless and quite chewy.

</div>

You haven't eaten mangoes until you've eaten Taiwanese mangoes. They're the kind that melts in your mouth in an ineffable explosion of sugary, fruity goodness. Layer them generously on a bed of shaved ice and topped off with some condensed milk and jelly bits, then you have mango shaved ice (芒果冰), the definitive dessert of a hot summer's day in Taiwan.

  <img alt="Taiwanese Breakfast Foods" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part1-breakfast.jpg">
</div>

There seems to be an endless variety of food that Taiwanese people eat for breakfast and/or lunch: from rice cakes and egg rolls to dumplings and baozi. It's a shame this stuff isn't more readily available in America, because this sure beats bacon and eggs.

  <img alt="Taiwanese Mantou" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part1-bao.jpg">
</div>

Mantou (饅頭) is a type of Chinese steamed bun that are eaten as breakfast or dimsum items. In Taiwan mantou refers to unfilled buns, while baozi refers to those with fillings, such as pork or even red bean. Whereas Americans eat toast in the morning, we Chinese people prefer our puffy steamed carbs.

  <img alt="Taiwanese Bean Cakes" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part1-beancake.jpg">
</div>

Red bean cakes (紅豆餅) are usually sold as snacks on the streets, usually also in other variations stuffed with sesame or cream fillings. They're some of the tastiest treats you can find on the side of the road for cheap, and most vendors make them on the spot, as they're best served fresh and hot.

  <img alt="Marinated Duck Parts" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part1-duckparts.jpg">
</div>

This is a pile of marinated duck parts, and my favorites are the livers and hearts. There's just something about the texture and the chewiness that make them better than any other part of the duck's anatomy. Who cares about the meat anyway?

  <img alt="Fish Ball Soup and Minced Beef Rice" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part1-fishballs.jpg">
</div>

Marinated minced beef with rice (肉燥飯) and fish ball soup (魚丸湯) are one of my favorite lunch options in Taiwan. It's a simple meal with distinctive flavors and lots of character, and this particular dish speaks volume about the local flavors that are well regarded in Tainan.

<div class="img-container">
  <img alt="Taiwanese Spring Roll" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part1-springroll.jpg">
</div>

I remember making Taiwanese spring rolls as a kid; we'd scoop peanut powder and brown sugar onto a sheet of rice paper and layer it with shredded mushrooms and meat and carrots before rolling it all up into a scrumptious creation. The flavor itself is unique: there's no dipping sauce normally associated with Vietnamese counterparts, because all the natural sugars are sealed inside to create a savory taste.

  <img alt="Taiwanese McDonalds" src="http://oasis.wikichen.com/writing/uploads/2013/08/eats-part1-mcdonalds.jpg">
</div>

I would never eat fast food when I'm in the U.S., but the McDonald's in Asia always have a way of introducing the most interesting spins on the Western abominations they advertise as food. Just look at that menu: burgers with weirdly colored buns, sesame-flavored drinks, and Hello Kitty kids meal toys. Tell me you're not at least curious, however unappetizing the mere idea of fast food is in this gastronomic wonderland.
