The Taipei Metro, colloquially known as the MRT, is the subway system serving metropolitan Taipei in Taiwan. When I was in Taipei a few weeks ago, what stood out to me was how modernized the public transport system was, and the delightful attention to detail sorely lacking in the design and maintenance of its Western counterpart in the Bay Area.

Anyone who's lived in the Bay Area, particularly those who have had to commute from the outer realms of South San Francisco or East Bay, has experienced the living hell that is the BART. It carries a measly 370,000 passengers on an average weekday compared to the 1.78 million on the MRT, and during rush hour the trains often overfill and break down, leaving the platforms dangerously congested and unpleasantly crowded.

Those waiting to board the trains would attempt to form disorganized lines that often block the entry point from which riders on the approaching train would exit, or they would get so long that those coming down the escalators to the platform would have trouble getting off. It's a frustrating experience for all those who depend on a functioning rapid transit system to live and work, and the pace at which the BART innovates leaves much to be desired. It's a bit ironic given the nature of the surrounding technology industry it serves.

In Taipei, what seems at first to be an amateur, almost inane, attempt to design a solution to the inherently disorderly transfer of riders in and out of trains turns out to subtly brilliant one.

Lines.

They drew lines on the ground.

At each gate indicating a door opening on the train, three lines form a pair of queues to the right, the left unmarked space reserved for the riders coming out of the train. You can't see it in the photo, but the queues bend at a sharp angle to the right, so that the middle of the platform is reserved as a walkway to and from the escalators and the staircases leading out of the station.

It's a system that needs no explanation, made even more self-evident by just how blatantly wrong the white guy is doing it in the picture. Bro, do you even ride?

What's even more surprising is how almost everyone implicitly abides by the system. Commuters would line up within the designated queues like children awaiting their turns in the school cafeteria, and when the doors open there's a smooth transition of people entering and exiting the train, almost with the fluidity of a well-executed Formula 1 pit stop synced in perfect choreography. Mesmerizing, to say the least, as someone who's had to punch his way onto a BART train on more than one occasion.

On a psychological level the lines work because they remove any cognitive load  for your average rider, especially at the end of the day when the last thing you want to be thinking about is how to queue up for your commute home. We're no more useful than goats by five, waiting to be herded back to our wooden pen by our metal shepherd. In Taipei, you just follow the lines like a civil member of society in exchange for the peace of mind that you'll get home on time for that Game of Thrones premiere and, as a bonus, avoid a grisly tramped death on the way there. Sounds like a win-win to me.

I don't know if this would work for the Bay Area with its fuck-the-system hipsters or holier-than-thou technorati, nor do I pretend to be an expert in urban transportation design. That said, a predilection for simple design details that can, and have proven in other more dramatic ways, unravel inefficacies in broken systems and improve user experience however small surely deserves a spot in industries more practical and less pass√© than the latest anonymity app. Not to mention how little it would cost to implement a small experiment like this at just one of the BART stations to boot.

Besides, orderly lines at a BART station? I'd pay to see that.
