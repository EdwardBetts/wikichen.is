*Without Their Permission* is Alexis Ohanian's rallying cry for the 21st century, an age where the sociocultural monolith erected by the Internet has bestowed unprecedented independence and distribution&mdash;powers that were once the exclusive domain of traditional gatekeepers&mdash;upon individual content creators and opportunistic upstarts.

It's a big, fat middle finger to the powers that be, but unfortunately manages to accomplish little else. In trying too hard to weave his personal triumphs (from building startups to fighting unjust legislation, not to say they aren't impressive) into a broader message of seizing one's destiny in the permissionless cyber frontier, his pseudo-memoir becomes muddled and polarizing, much like the temporal black hole that is reddit.

By nature of being the poster child for Silicon Valley in the public sphere, Ohanian's casual tone and pedestrian approach to storytelling make sense if maximizing readership is the goal, all the more made self-evident when Ohanian appeared on [The Colbert Report](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/430524/november-14-2013/alexis-ohanian) to promote the book. (It's also the only logical conclusion I've drawn as to why some parts of the book can sound downright condescending, as if the reader has had zero experience with the series of tubes we call the Internet.) It came at the cost of alienting those in the tech scene who follow him closely and would benefit from Ohanian's insights as an entrepreneur&mdash;this is not a book for those who want to learn about startups, and certainly not for those who frequent Hacker News.

The very message championed by Ohanian and his stories in *Without Their Permission*&mdash;that by embracing the open the Internet we stand to make the world suck less&mdash;is ultimately drowned out by an incoherent narrative that, nonetheless, reveals an endearingly optimistic voice that has come to embody the zeitgeist of a generation who grew up and found home on the web.
