It's always a good time with my indispensable friend Alex Poon. We stopped by [Ramen Dojo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-dojo-san-mateo) in San Mateo to see if the hype is justified--admittedly, it was one of the better bowls of ramen I've tasted in the Bay Area, but you still can't beat LA for authentic Japanese ramen.
