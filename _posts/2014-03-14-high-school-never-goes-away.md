Perhaps it was the fact that I'm currently on hiatus from life with ample free time to reflect and work on my own projects, or maybe the fact that I'm a little lost in life and I have been wandering for years and the last bout of clarity in which I knew what to make of myself was in high school, if my memory serves me correctly. For whatever the reason, I decided to pay my favorite high school teacher a visit yesterday.

Mrs. Wan was my computer science teacher in tenth grade, who is in the unfair position of claiming responsibility for being the largest contributing factor of my decision to apply to Carnegie Mellon and study computer science there. If you've read any of my previous posts, you'll understand why in hindsight it wasn't the best personal path I could've chosen. But there's nothing to be gained from crying over spilled milk and so I will refrain from talking about that here.

I can't pinpoint exactly how our friendship came to be, but there was a mutual appreciation for grounded pessimism and the "tough love" kind of snarky and playful banter that, at least for me, made the uneventfully pleasant and all-to-innocuous years of high school bearable. She was one of the few adults in my life with whom I could converse with no filter, and in many instances I do admit the dialogue would derail into rather one-sided, pent-up bitching. You know, bitching only reserved for those you hold dearest, the ones who unconditionally reserve judgment when you act like a little shithead. She was someone I saw as a friend with a lot more life experience to call on and in that way she was less of a teacher and more of a mentor on generously friendly terms and at that time, and maybe even now, having someone to fill that role was something I desperately needed.

I would spend my lunches in the computer lab where she had an office---this is where it's starting to dawn upon me that I might have always been a little screwed up as a kid and in a way I haven't exactly grown out of that mold---because I found the world outside inhabited by peers and acquaintances, who more often than not engage in the most mindless drivel, particularly unappealing. And so those lunches were the highlight of my school days. In my experience, the teachers people tend to remember aren't necessarily the ones who teach best, but the ones with whom you form inexplicably deep connections. Mrs. Wan was one of them.

Returning to the campus was a particularly scary and sudden wakeup call, made self-evident by the way my attire has changed from random T-shirt with jeans in sneakers into a full-blown hipster approved ensemble of grey sweater over a plaid collared shirt in beeswax leather boots, and that the last time I sulked across these grounds with kids at this age was five years ago. Five fucking years. That's half a fucking decade. *I'm getting too old for this shit.*

But on the outside, not much has changed. The school still bore an unhealthy resemblance to an outdoor prison, and when Mrs. Wan came to fetch me at the front office it was like nothing had changed at all. It was a walk made too familiar by the bleakness of it all.

We headed back to her classroom, now facing a different side of the school, and caught up like old friends would---giving each other shit. She teaches Psychology instead of Economics and CS now, which probably explains why she looked a little happier than I recalled. I'm currently unemployed and clueless about my next steps, which probably explains why I looked even more somber than she remembered.

I told her of my exploits after I graduated, jumping from opportunity to opportunity and job from job with the attention span of a goldfish. I spanned career verticals, joined failed startups, started failed startups, moved across the country and back and no less than five separate occasions, gave up on more projects than I could count, all to what end? I'm more discontent than ever.

As for Mrs. Wan, she said she was finally complacent with how her life is. She's dropped all of her club responsibilities, so she goes home everyday at 2pm and spends the rest of the day doing things she enjoys. She's in a happy place.

"You know, you were kind of like this back in high school," she smiled.

"No way. I had a particular sense of purpose, all these dreams and aspirations after graduation," I cried rather indignantly.

"Yeah, but you were always, what's the word, indecisive."

"Well, come to think of it..."

"You know, there were only a few moments back then where you displayed some kind of conviction and decisiveness," she said. "It was when you started that video game club and when you said your endgame is to work for yourself on something bigger than yourself, something impactful."

She wasn't wrong. The fact that I have no sense of direction after all this self-exploration after college is proof of some inherently restless part of myself and ambiguity about what I really want from life. But as we talked I realized to my pleasant surprise that I do have a plan in the back of my head. There are two things that I'm going to do in the foreseeable future that hopefully help shed light on where I take my life:

* Find a job.
* Go back to school.

As for the far future, in five years' time, who knows. Maybe I'll figure it out, maybe I won't. Maybe I will start that company I've always wanted to. But for once I'm at least decisive about being decisive. At this stage of my life, I've accepted that I'll need to shelve my higher ambitions to gain some needed experience and perspective. I need to make peace with the restlessness and settle down, at least for a while.

"You know, this isn't going to go away, your need for change and exploration and not being able to make up your mind," she said to me as we parted ways, "but you'll be fine."

I sure hope so, too.
