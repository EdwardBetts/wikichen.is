A few days ago I received an email from a reader (who might be sole constituent of my readership) whose kindness and candidness moved me beyond any correspondence I've ever had the pleasure of receiving.

I want to reproduce a part of her email here, because it lends context to my motivations as a writer and as someone who's only recently begun to leverage writing as a means to rediscover himself. I've also tidied up some misspellings for legbility, but her message remains as beautifully honest as its original.

> You write about loneliness. I learnt two years ago, that the worst kind of loneliness (for me, anyway) is when I'm surrounded by people but feeling absolutely..alone. I remember times when I was at a bar, having drinks with 10 people, and hating every second of it. That's when I decided to only be with people who I really want to be with. Not get tied to social obligations. Not go out for the sake of going out.
>
> I recently moved to Singapore. You would think I'd be lonelier, being in a new country, but in general I'm happier. I have way less friends. I deactivated my Facebook and Instagram. I agree with you completely when you talk about how social media has taken loneliness to a new level. I'm sick and tired of it - this constant battle (whether people realize they're in it or not) to check in to the so-called coolest places, to put up pictures of themselves being happening, etc. Honestly, I'm much happier now that I've gotten off social media. Consciously or subconsciously, I believe Facebook pressures us into trying to show the world we're fucking happy. I'm not completely off social media - I tweet, but most of my friends don't know I'm on twitter despite it being a public account. I blog, but again, I don't give the address to my friends. I admire you putting up your stuff on Reddit, free for Internet trolls to pounce on. I want that courage, but I don't have it. I am too frightened of the haters, the naysayers, the assholes that make the world go round.

> I also wanted to share with you that I find your writing highly relatable. It is somewhat comforting for me to read what you feel / go through - because some of it is very similar to how i feel.  I like the honesty. You talk about being lost in life, and how you have failed start ups. I'd like to tell you that I spent the past 5 years clawing up the corporate ladder in a very stable job (I'm still in my first job) busy being stable, and now, to be honest, I feel a little lost too. What your teacher quoted to you was somewhat similar to what my country manager told me when I attempted to leave my job. (essentially, I liked the company, but I was promised a move abroad and it didn't happen so I got angry and decided to leave).

> I spoke about complacency, about needing change, about growth, and this is what he said to me:
>
> "Even when we move you to a new country, be it Singapore, New York, Japan, Paris, whatever - remember that in a couple of years, you will feel this restlessness again. In Hindi, we have a saying. Translated to English, it means something like 'Talent is a burden'. This talent is what's going to make frustrated when you do more than other people. This talent will bubble in you and cause you to feel restless. As you get older, you'll learn to manage it. But I just want to warn you that this restlessness will always stay with you."

> I'm not trying to tell you in a very un-subtle manner that I'm talented. Rather, I think what he's saying can exactly be applied to you. I don't know you. I only know you through your writing and what you choose to portray to the world. But - you seem a bit lost, a bit sad, a little resigned maybe, and I think maybe you have forgotten your core talents, or your ambition that has driven you to try a start up. So it failed. Big deal. People fail a thousand times before they succeed. It doesn't make you a failure. I always believe every time I make a mistake it brings me one step closer to my intended goal. At least you had the courage and drive to try. Don't lose the idealism, don't get jaded! I slowly feel myself becoming a little more cynical every day, and I don't like it.
>
> My point is - you would probably be bored to death too in a stable job. Feeling lost - it's not mutually exclusive to job-hoppers. I'm lost, and I'm as stable as you can get. Everyone thinks I'm a dinosaur in my company. I used to want this, but now maybe I crave something different, and the worst part is I don't know what it is.
>
> Me writing you this long email is of course, not entirely altruistic. I want to write more, but I have been uninspired for a long time. Reading you makes me feel like writing again. Heck, you inspired a very long and rambly email from me. I've been trying to write like a motherfucker but it's so hard. That's why I want you to write more, so that I write more, for myself.
>
> So, keep writing. Your writing makes a difference.

On my third pass through her letter, I cried so abruptly and uncontrollably I felt embarrassed if not for the fact that it felt good, shamelessly cathartic in a way I haven't felt in a long time because something, or someone, finally broke through the dam of negative feelings and high-strung expectations I've built up for myself over the years.

I cried because this was the nicest thing anyone's said to me since I lost my way. I cried because not even my own friends talk to me like this anymore, with a sobering humility and honesty that cut through the vanities and niceties and the bullshit. I cried because a complete stranger from Singapore gave me hope and encouragement and conviction where there were none in my own life.

It took a complete stranger from Singapore to help me realize that I'm tired of  the charades in my online interactions, that I'm tired of living up to the public persona I've created for myself, one ever donning a facade as a selfish, pathetic means to shield myself from my own mismatched realities.

Some days it feels like writing is all I have. I never wrote about dropping out of YC to get on the front page of Hacker News. I never wrote about loneliness for all the attention it's gotten. I write when I'm most vulnerable and it's always been how I cope with the shitshow that is my life. I write when I'm sad, sad that I don't know what I'm passionate about, sad that I'm never satisfied with where I am in life, sad that I just don't have anything figured out.

Honestly, I don't know if I'll ever figure it out. For all I know this is another soon-to-be coffin in the graveyard of online journals I leave behind. But I'll be damned if I ever write another post that's not from the heart, that favors the disingenuous over the unapologetically vulnerable. It may catch flak and have the haters' panties all rolled up in a bunch, but as long as it helps connect me with another human being and resonates with them positively in some way, I'll keep at it. I'll keep at it because I'm not giving up on myself, and I'll at it because it's letters like this that makes it beyond worthwhile.

To anyone who delights in writing, whether as a coping mechanism or as a recreational outlet, I encourage you to share your writing, as rough and mediocre and unflattering and unpresentable as you find it, because no one is perfect and to portray yourself otherwise would be doing your readers and yourself a disservice. And who knows, maybe your writing can a make a difference to someone, too. So keep writing.
