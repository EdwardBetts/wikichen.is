    <p class="intro" markdown="1">My (real) name is <em>Jonathan E. Chen</em>. I go by <em>wikichen</em> on the web. I can't exactly say what I am&mdash;defined as a member of society, not as an entity in the universe, in which case I would be a homo sapien, an animal, a collection of atoms, sentient stardust, and so forth&mdash;because I haven't exactly found it yet, so I've decided to collect a whole bunch of things I do to make sense of my life here and hope it leads me somewhere. Who knows, maybe I don't need to know what I am to the world to mean something to it.</p>
